                            It all began with a puff. 28 years ago, in the humble abode of a small residence in Pasir
                            Ris, an inspired Mr Wong decided to experiment on and come up with his own version of curry
                            puff, after first tasting it from a roadside stall.

                        <p>
                            Fast-forward 28 years to today. Brian's Curry Puff has gained an immense following and a
                            cult status among curry puff lovers in Singapore. The taste and quality of our puffs have
                            remained exactly the same from the day it was first sold.

                            Now happily retired and married with 2 children, Mr Wong acts a consultant to Brian's Curry
                            Puff, and has plans to open more outlets here and overseas.
